* Familiarize yourself with asdf extensions, Converters and schemas.

### Before first evaluation: Implement ASDF serialization for Maps 

* Write Converters, schemas and associated tests for MapAxis, MapAxes.
* Write Converters, schemas and associated tests for Geom classes.
* Write Converters, schemas and associated tests for Map classes.

### Final evaluation

* Write Converters, schemas and associated tests for MapDataset classes.
* 


* Finished the awesome stuff.
